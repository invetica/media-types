*Media Types* knows how to parse, and generate media type strings that you might
use in HTTP content negotiation.

* Why this library?
Other solutions exist but are either a bit too featureful. This library aims to
be small, lightweight, easy to use, and fast.

For a more complete solution that includes detection of file types, can suggest
extensions etc. you might want to check out [[https://tika.apache.org/][Apache Tika]].

* Usage
You can parse a string media type into a map of ~:toptype~, ~:subtype~, and
~:params~, where the media type string is of the form:

#+begin_example
<toptype>/<subtype>[; params]+
#+end_example

Given a media type of "application/json; charset=utf-8", we can parse this into
a map like so:

#+begin_src clojure
  (require '[invetica.media-types :as media])
  (media/parse "application/json; charset=utf-8")
  ;; => {:params {"charset" "utf-8"}
  ;;     :subtype "javascript"
  ;;     :toptype "application"}
#+end_src

* Tests
The test suite makes sure we can parse every registered media type, which
requires a bit of XML pulled from IANA. This data is vendored into the
repository to save IANA's bandwidth, and to ensure we don't need the internet to
run our tests.

You can pull the latest list of registered media types using curl like so:

#+begin_src bash
  mkdir -p dev-resources/invetica
  curl -o dev-resources/invetica/media-types.xml \
    https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xml
#+end_src
